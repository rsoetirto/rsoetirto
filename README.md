### My name is Rania Soetirto. Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

**About me:**
<br>

I recently earned an M.S. in Business Analytics from the University of Southern California (USC). I'm interested in the interdisciplinary nature of data-driven storytelling across media, tech, and business. 

With a bachelor's degree in English and experience in broadcast, streaming, and communications, I bring a unique blend of **communication** and **data**, the **humanities** and the **sciences**—integrating these inseparable elements to generate actionable business and management insights.

Follow my coding journey here! I code in **R**, **SQL**, and **Python**. 

Please don't hesitate to reach out for any collaborations or just to say hi.
