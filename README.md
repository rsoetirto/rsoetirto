**About me:**
<br>

I recently earned an M.S. in Business Analytics from the University of Southern California (USC). I'm interested in the interdisciplinary nature of data-driven storytelling across media, tech, and business. 

Armed with a bachelor's degree in English and and previous work experience in TV and broadcast, my unique background reflects my fervor for synthesizing **communication** and **data**, the **humanities** and the **sciences**, as insperable parts to generate actionable insights. 

Follow my coding journey here! I code in **R**, **SQL**, and **Python**. 

Please don't hesitate to reach out for any collaborations or just to say hi.
